This directory will serve to link external repositories as a submodule and include different REST projects.

We provide here access to public projects as `basic-readouts`, `basic-geometry` and `basic-simulations` that can also be used for validation.

And also project related repositories related to `iaxo-` and `trexdm-` projects that will be accessible to collaboration members of each project.
