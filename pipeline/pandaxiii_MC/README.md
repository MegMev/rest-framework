The following scripts are used to validate the PandaX-III simulation & topological analysis chain.

- **step 1**: Use `restG4 Xe136bb0n.rml` to run test Geant4 simulation. Use `ValidateG4.C` to check if the simulation
  produced the expected output. i.e. all 500 events are simulated and metadata is correctly recorded. The output file
  will be used later on.

- **step 2**: Use AllProcesses.rml to run restManager for REST simulation and topological analysis. `processes_2D.`
  rml` and
  `readout-140kg.rml` is included by it.

- **step 3**: Use plots.rml to check the plots can be successfully drawn by TRestAnalysisPlot

File `Xe136bb0n_n2E06_reference.root` corresponds to the file generated by step 1 using 10.4.2 and contains 10 events.
